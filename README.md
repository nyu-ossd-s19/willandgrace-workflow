We learned how to add a LICENSE to a repository.

Will - learned how to fork a project and add an upstream (exactly what the section said to do! I hadn't done it before.)

We worked through issue opening and resolution, and learned how to branch and manage pull requests. Dealing with a simple merge conflict was a new experience but not a difficult one to resolve. The most complex part of this process has been keeping track of the upstream master and continuously pushing/pulling in the right order so that local changes don't get accidently overwritten.
